# Brute-Force Caesar Cipher
  This code is for the simple Caesar Cipher in which you have three different commands you can use. One for brute force decrypt, one for decrypting the cipher with a key, and one to encrypt using a key.

  Brute Force (bc) decrypting looks for words that appear through the loop that results from the program.
  
  Decrypt w/ Key (dc) just moves the encrypted message by the amount of times you have your key.
  
  Encrypt w/ Key (ec) loops through and shifts the message by the key.
