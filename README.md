## Introduction

This code is for the simple Caesar Cipher in which you have three different commands you can use. One for brute force decrypt, one for decrypting the cipher with a key, and one to encrypt using a key.

## Usage

##### Brute Force:
    Usage: Run Cipher Tools.py and input bc

    Notes: decrypting looks for words that appear through the loop that results from the program.
    
##### Decrypt w/ Key:
    Usage: Run Cipher Tools.py and input dc
    
    Notes: just moves the encrypted message by the amount of times you have your key.

##### Encrypt w/ Key:
    Usage: Run Cipher Tools.py and input ec
    
    Notes: loops through and shifts the message by the key.
